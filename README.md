## Overview
### Description
This app is for patients at Children's Hospitals, and people who have gone through similar experiences who will be paired with the patients to be their penpals. In particular, I want to start by focusing on pediatric oncology, and matching current pediatric cancer patients with childhood cancer survivors. This app can also be used by parents of patients, as a resource and to communicate with other parents or survivors.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Networking, Matching
- **Mobile:** This will be a mobile app, as it is meant for patients and former patients to connect and share resources together, and utilize mobile communication/interaction.
- **Story:** Being able to connect with someone who has gone through a similar experience as you is very valuable, especially when it comes to something like having cancer, or other medical experiences with lots of unkowns.
- **Market:** This app can be used by any patient at a childrens hospital, parent of a patient, or someone who wants to interact as a penpal partner.
- **Habit:** This app can be used at any point of a patient's cancer journey, and is meant to be a helpful resource to make the process a little less daunting to navigate.
- **Scope:** V1 could be focused on matching current cancer patients with cancer survivors, and exchanging contact information between matches. V2 would allow for in-app messaging and communication between matches. V3 would include matching between more people than just current and former patients, for example, parents, siblings, and family members.
